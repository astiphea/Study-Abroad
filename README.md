**PhD Doctoral programs**

Remember earning a PhD is free. Every university will offer a full tuition scholarship + living stipend to earn your doctoral degree at their university. If you want to get a PhD look at programs while you're still working on your bachelor's or master's to plan your classes to get into the PhD programs you're interested in. Reach out to professors at the Universities you want to attend. Use the faculty search feature to find professors in your field of study and see what they are researching. They will be happy to answer any questions you have about potentially attending their classes because they get paid when you enroll.

**Art Residency**
Did you know you can get paid to do your art? Artists Residencies aka Artist in Residence (AiR) programs pay artists of all types to come to their city, university, or organization to create art and teach workshops. Some even offer free living accomodations and stipends for food, supplies, research, conferences, and travel. If you have not created any art yet, get started now. Build an art portfolio on a free website using free plain templates on WordPress. People can follow and share your art with others.
